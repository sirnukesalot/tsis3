#You can send any data types of argument to a function (string, number, list, dictionary etc.), and it will be treated as the same data type inside the function.

#E.g. if you send a List as an argument, it will still be a List when it reaches the function:

def my_function(food):
  for x in food:
    print(x)

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

my_function(fruits)
