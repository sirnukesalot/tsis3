#Information can be passed into functions as arguments.

#Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma.

#The following example has a function with one argument (fname). When the function is called, we pass along a first name, which is used inside the function to print the full name:

def my_function(fname):
  print(fname + " Refsnes")

my_function("Emil")
my_function("Tobias")
my_function("Linus")
