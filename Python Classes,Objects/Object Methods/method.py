#Objects can also contain methods. Methods in objects are functions that belong to the object.

#Let us create a method in the Person class:

#Insert a function that prints a greeting, and execute it on the p1 object:

class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  def myfunc(self):
    print("Hello my name is " + self.name)

p1 = Person("John", 36)
p1.myfunc()
#Note: The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belong to the class.
